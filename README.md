### Живе місто (Live city)

Kyiv is the capital of Ukraine, but also much more than that. In the end you will find

something. That project shows	city from an unusual perspective. You will find existing objects

and architecture, but transformed to reveal its hidden sense and feelings of a city dweller.

It is art and technology, mixed together.
